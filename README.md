# Forest-Based Binary Classification Study

For the MSc Econometrics & Management Science, specializing in Business Analytics & Quantitative Marketing [BAQM], at the Erasmus School of Economics [ESE] in Rotterdam, I have conducted a computational study regarding forest-based binary classification for the course "Machine Learning" in Python awarded with a 9.5. In particular, I compared decision trees, random forests, and the novel MIRCO method with anticipated enhanced performance and interpretability capabilities, on a German Credit Dataset. In particular, I propose an algorithm that makes MIRCO a classification algorithm. Furthermore, I examine efficient and scalable implementations of MIRCO by comparing a greedy algorithm, and a List-and-Remove [LAR] algorithm [Yang et al., 2015] used to implement it. Moreover, I present simplifications to the MIRCO output that enhances interpretability of the results, such as compacting rules concerning the same variables, or providing a compact overview of the structure of the resulting rules by graphing a tree of pairs of sets of rules that have the most feature space in common.
